## **🚀 MQTT-Based WASM Execution Engine**  

Welcome to the **MQTT-Based WASM Execution Engine!** 🎉  
This project enables seamless execution of **WebAssembly (WASM) workloads** over **MQTT protocol**, allowing efficient remote execution on lightweight embedded devices.  

### **✨ Features**  
✅ **MQTT-Based Execution** – WASM workloads are sent as MQTT messages for remote execution.  
✅ **AOT Execution** – Supports **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled** WASM for optimal performance.  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Minimal resource usage, making it ideal for embedded and IoT environments.  
✅ **Two Primary Signals:**  
   - `wasm/start` – Start execution of a WASM module.  
   - `wasm/kill` – Stop the running WASM instance.

## **📌 Prerequisites**  

Before building and running the project, install the required dependencies:  

### **🔹 Install Required Packages**  
**For Ubuntu/Debian:**  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake libssl-dev mosquitto-clients
```

**For Fedora/RHEL:**  
```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ make cmake openssl-devel mosquitto-clients
```

**For Arch Linux:**  
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu base-devel cmake openssl mosquitto
```

### **🔹 Install `paho.mqtt.c` (MQTT Client Library)**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
cd paho.mqtt.c
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
cmake --build build --target install
cd ..
```

### **🔹 Install WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime)**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime.git
cd wasm-micro-runtime
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ../..
```

## **🛠️ Build the Project**  

Clone the repository and build the project using **Makefile**:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
cd your_repo
make
```

## **🚀 Running the WASM Execution Service**  

### **1️⃣ Start an MQTT Broker (Mosquitto)**
If you don’t have an MQTT broker running, start a local Mosquitto instance:  
```bash
mosquitto -v
```
Or use a cloud-hosted MQTT broker like **HiveMQ** or **EMQX**.

### **2️⃣ Start the WASM Execution Engine**
Run the executable to start listening for MQTT messages:  
```bash
./wasm_executor
```

### **3️⃣ Publish a WASM Module (Start Execution)**
Send a **precompiled AOT WASM module** using `mosquitto_pub`:  
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <MQTT_BROKER_IP> -t "wasm/start" -f my_aot_module.aot
```

### **4️⃣ Stop Execution (Kill Signal)**
To stop the running WASM instance:  
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <MQTT_BROKER_IP> -t "wasm/kill" -m "terminate"
```

---

## **📌 Notes**  
- Ensure your WASM module is compiled using **WAMR’s AOT compilation** before execution.  
- The project currently supports **MQTT-based message exchange** but can be extended to other protocols.  

---

## **💡 Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Add support for **WASM-SN (WASM Secure Networking)**.  
🔹 Implement **execution state tracking** and real-time logs.  
🔹 Extend support for **multiple concurrent WASM workloads**.
